## Plan and Research
As I spoke with the clent throughout the 2 weeks we explored several website themes. He also sent me the relevant info he wanted me to display on the website. It was cler that the debsite design he was after should be both professional, yet also engaging a eye-catching.
I thought about the best way to capture this and after reviewing some templates online, I settled for one I thought was best.
I kept in contact with the client as I built the website and the feedback seemed to align with my own thoughts. Advice was also received on several edits which were added.
If at any point I was unsure about how to add a feature, I found what I wanted to include online and this was a great help. Some features didn't perform as initially intended but with trial and error and more googling, I was able to execute the website as I'd planned.
## Design
I thought an image of Amdad would be best as the homepage with minimal text, introducing him. I left the information about Amdad in a seperate page as an interview style profile for the user to get to know him. The final webpage I added to increase user engagement.
